# goblin_math
boot dev first unguided personal project

It's a simple game where you click buttons to solve math problems. The current implementation setup only generates addition problems, with 2 choices and at most 1 away from the actual answer. It has the full capability to generate any amount of choices or variance. It could even add as many things together as you want. But for now, I will leave the project as it is.

if you download the zip and have an environment to run python code you'll want to run main.py.
this was devolped and tested using python 3.12.3
